This directory contains major snapshots and intermediate versions that were used to
validate changes from one version to another.

Note: 1.12b and 1.11b are effectively the same version (snapshot from JTM)
It was renumbered from 1.12b to 1.11b in the comments to reflect that the
conversion was done before 1.12 was created.
